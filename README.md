# Digital System Design: Verilog Data Modeling with Vivado

Welcome to my repository for **Digital System Design** using **Verilog** and **Vivado**. In this project, I have implemented **Verilog data modeling** and simulations for hardware design, providing insights into **parameterized modules** and **register-transfer level (RTL)** design.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Verilog code and simulation files created during the **Digital System Design** lab course. It focuses on creating and verifying digital circuits through Verilog, with the goal of mastering FPGA programming and hardware acceleration.

## Key Features
- **Verilog Data Modeling**: Represent real-world data and control structures using Verilog's powerful data types.
- **Parameterized Modules**: Design reusable and efficient hardware modules.
- **Simulation**: Utilize Vivado’s simulation tools to check functionality and debug designs.
- **Waveform Analysis**: Analyze and interpret waveform outputs to verify circuit behavior.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the simulations and Verilog code, you’ll need:
- **Vivado** (for Verilog simulations and FPGA programming)
- Basic knowledge of **Verilog** and **digital system design principles**

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayyash1/DLD_LAB-03.git
